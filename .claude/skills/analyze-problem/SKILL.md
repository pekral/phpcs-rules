# Analyze Problem

## Purpose
Perform structured problem analysis before proposing or implementing any changes.

Focus on:
- verified facts
- multiple hypotheses
- root cause identification
- validation strategy

---

## Constraints
- Apply @rules/php/core-standards.mdc
- Never modify code
- Output Markdown only
- Use one language only
- Do not jump directly to solutions
- Do not assume a single cause
- Be explicit about uncertainty

---

## Execution

- Analyze the problem and all available context.
- If relevant, load issue, comments, and attachments using available CLI or MCP tools.
- Prefer issue-tracker-specific tools over generic browsing.
- Walk through the Analysis Framework below in order — do not skip steps.
- Separate facts from assumptions and from hypotheses.
- Identify the most probable root cause and how to validate it.
- Recommend the smallest safe solution and explain rejected alternatives.

---

## Analysis Framework

Apply these 10 steps in order. Each step feeds the next — never jump ahead to a solution before evidence and root cause are settled.

1. **Context extraction** — what we actually know from the assignment, comments, attachments, and surrounding code.
2. **Problem statement** — one precise sentence describing the real problem.
3. **Expected vs actual behavior** — what should happen, and what is happening instead.
4. **Evidence** — logs, screenshots, issue comments, files, reproduction steps. Verified facts only.
5. **Root cause hypothesis** — the most likely cause, clearly separated from facts. State certainty.
6. **Impact / risk** — who and what is affected (users, business, technical, risk areas).
7. **Smallest safe solution** — the smallest, lowest-risk fix that addresses the root cause.
8. **Alternatives rejected** — competing solutions considered and why they were not chosen.
9. **Verification plan** — manual checks, automated tests, edge cases, and regression checks.
10. **Non-technical summary** — plain-language explanation for PM, support, or business stakeholders.

## Output Structure

The output uses the template at `templates/analysis-report.md`. The template has 11 sections that map onto the framework above:

1. **Summary** — short summary (covers steps 1–2)
2. **Problem Definition** — problem statement, expected/actual behavior, affected area, problem type (steps 2–3)
3. **Verified Facts** — verified facts only (step 4)
4. **Assumptions and Missing Information** — assumptions and unknowns (supports step 5)
5. **Probable Root Cause** — root cause, certainty, alternative causes (step 5)
6. **Problem Impact** — user/business impact, technical impact, risk areas (step 6)
7. **Recommended Solution** — recommended solution, things to avoid, side effects (steps 7–8)
8. **Implementation Outline** — likely change locations, recommended steps, architecture notes (step 7)
9. **Solution Verification** — manual checks, automated tests, edge cases, regression checks (step 9)
10. **Non-Technical Explanation** — explanation for non-technical stakeholders (step 10)
11. **Final Recommendation** — final recommendation, priority, next step

Fill every section. If a section has nothing to report, write a short explicit note (e.g. `No missing information.`) instead of leaving placeholders.

## Principles

- Focus on root cause, not symptoms
- Prefer evidence over assumptions
- Avoid confirmation bias
- Keep analysis structured and concise
- Prefer simple explanations over complex ones

## UI Redesign Lens

Apply this lens **only when the analyzed problem is a UI / UX redesign or a new user-facing flow** — detected when the assignment, the loaded issue, or its comments talk about layout, screen, page, dashboard, form, wizard, modal, widget, navigation, look & feel, accessibility, or any other end-user interaction surface. Skip the lens entirely for backend-only, infrastructure, performance, or tooling problems.

When it fires, the lens fixes the design direction of the **Recommended Solution** (step 7 of the framework) and the wording of the **Non-Technical Explanation** (step 10) so the analysis cannot drift into a complex, multi-screen, jargon-heavy design without an explicit reason:

- **Simple** — the screen carries the minimum surface that solves the user's job. Every input, button, copy block, illustration, and toggle on the proposed design must trace to a concrete user need stated in the assignment. Speculative knobs, "in case" filters, and decorative chrome are rejected the same way speculative code is rejected by `@rules/php/core-standards.mdc` *Design Principles*.
- **Intuitive** — the user reaches the goal without reading documentation. Primary action is unambiguous and placed where the user already looks; affordances match platform conventions (web / mobile / desktop) the user has internalised; nothing relies on a hidden gesture or an undocumented shortcut.
- **Readable for humans** — the layout follows a clear visual hierarchy (one primary call-to-action per view, secondary actions visibly demoted, supporting copy in plain language at the user's reading level), respects a comfortable line length and information density, and meets the project's accessibility baseline (WCAG AA contrast, keyboard focus order, screen-reader labels, no colour-only signal) unless the assignment explicitly de-scopes accessibility.
- **Modern** — the design follows current UI conventions of the framework / design system the project already uses (Tailwind UI, Filament, Material, Apple HIG, the project's in-house design tokens). Do not reintroduce patterns the platform has retired (1990s-style modal stacks, full-page reloads on every interaction, dense data tables with no progressive disclosure on mobile widths).
- **One-click default** — for any action the analysis recommends, prefer a single-click / single-tap completion over a multi-step flow. A confirmation step is allowed only when the action is destructive, irreversible, financially material, legally significant, or affects a third party — and the **Recommended Solution** must name which of those reasons justifies the extra click.
- **Wizard fallback when multi-step is unavoidable** — when the underlying job genuinely cannot fit one click (compound input, branching prerequisites, server-side processing between steps), recommend a wizard pattern with these mandatory properties: every step states its purpose and its position in the flow (*Step 2 of 4 — Billing address*); the user can move back without losing entered data; the user can save and resume later when the flow exceeds three steps; each step validates inline and surfaces field-level errors per the rules in `@rules/security/backend.md` / `@rules/security/frontend.md` *Safe Validation & Error Messages*; the final step shows a summary of every choice before commit. Reject wizard variants that hide progress, require the user to backtrack through a different surface to fix an earlier mistake, or block forward navigation behind a hidden prerequisite.

Record the design verdict in the **Recommended Solution** section using these exact subheadings so a reader can scan the lens output deterministically: *Simplicity*, *Intuitiveness*, *Readability*, *Modernity*, *One-click vs wizard decision* (one sentence — *one click* or *N-step wizard*, plus the reason). When the design is *N-step wizard*, also list the wizard's mandatory properties met by the proposal. Do not relax any of the six rules silently — when the assignment forces a deviation (e.g. the brand requires a non-standard interaction), cite the assignment passage that authorizes it.
