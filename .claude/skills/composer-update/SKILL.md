# Composer Update

## Purpose
Analyze dependency updates after `composer update`, detect conflicts, and summarize relevant changes.

---

## Constraints
- Apply @rules/php/core-standards.mdc
- Output Markdown only

---

## Execution

### 1. Update Context
- Use output from `composer update` if available
- Otherwise compare current `composer.lock` with the previous version

### 2. Detect Updated Packages
- List all added or changed packages
- Include version changes: `old → new`

### 3. Conflict Detection
- Identify dependency conflicts from:
    - composer output
    - version constraint mismatches (`composer.json` vs `composer.lock`)
- Summarize conflicts clearly (package → reason)
- If none: state "No conflicts detected"

### 4. Changelog Extraction
For each updated package:

- Prefer:
    - `vendor/<package>/CHANGELOG*`
- Fallback:
    - repository releases (GitHub/GitLab)
    - package homepage

- Extract:
    - breaking changes
    - new features
    - important fixes

- If unavailable:
    - state "No changelog found"

### 5. Suggested Follow-up
- Recommend relevant checks:
    - run tests
    - `composer validate`
    - `composer audit`

## Output Format

Use the template defined in `templates/update-report.md`.

## Principles

- Highlight breaking changes first
- Prefer local sources over remote
- Be concise and actionable
- Highlight security-related changes when present

## Output Humanization
- Use [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) for all skill outputs to keep the text natural and human-friendly.
