# Code Review (GitHub)

## Purpose
Run a full code review for GitHub pull requests and publish findings directly to the PR.

---

## Constraints
- Apply @rules/git/general.mdc
- Apply @rules/reports/general.mdc. The **technical CR PR comment** this skill posts on the GitHub PR (Status / Counts / Findings / Refactoring / Coverage / Summary) stays in canonical English per the rule's *Exception — technical CR findings on the GitHub PR*. The **non-technical mirror** delegated to `@skills/pr-summary/SKILL.md` for every `closingIssues[]` linked GitHub issue follows the language of the source assignment. Never mix languages inside the same comment; never use bilingual *Kritické (Critical)* style parentheses.
- **Read-only skill** — never modify code, never stage / commit / push changes, and never run any git write operation (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git reset`, `git checkout -- …`, etc.). Switching to the relevant branch and `git pull` to read the latest diff are allowed; mutating the working tree or pushing to the remote is not. Publishing is limited to PR / linked-issue comments via `gh`.
- Output findings only (no praise)

---

## Execution

### 1. Load Context
- Load PR context by running `skills/code-review-github/scripts/load-issue.sh <NUMBER|URL>` — the single deterministic entry point. Never call `gh issue view`, `gh pr view`, or `gh api /repos/.../issues/...` directly. Read PR header, description, comments, commits, files, reviews, status checks, and `closingIssues` off the resulting JSON document.
- Load each linked issue (from `closingIssues[]`) the same way — pass its number or URL to the same script.
- If the script is unavailable (missing tool, exit code 2/3) fall back to the GitHub MCP server. Always prefer the MCP fallback for data the script cannot cover: review-thread / line-anchored comments, per-commit check runs, and binary attachment contents.
- If multiple PRs exist for one issue, review each independently
- Before reviewing a PR, switch to the PR branch and pull latest changes

#### Issue Context Analysis
Before reviewing code, load and analyze the full linked issue:

1. Fetch the complete GitHub issue via `skills/code-review-github/scripts/load-issue.sh <NUMBER|URL>` — description, all comments, and any referenced attachments or links come off the resulting JSON document.
2. Extract from the issue:
   - **Requirements and acceptance criteria** — what the code must do
   - **Expected behavior** — how the feature or fix should work
   - **Edge cases and constraints** — mentioned by the reporter or in comments
   - **Test data** — any sample inputs, payloads, or scenarios provided in the issue
3. Use this context to evaluate whether the implementation fully satisfies the issue — not just whether the code is technically correct.
4. If the issue contains test data or test scenarios, verify they are covered by existing or new tests. Flag missing test coverage as a finding.

### 2. Pre-checks
- If PR has merge conflicts → cancel review

### 3. Run Reviews

- Always run:
    - @skills/assignment-compliance-check/SKILL.md — non-technical business-logic vs assignment check. The skill **does not publish anywhere itself** — it returns the assembled `## Assignment Compliance` markdown block (or the status `no linked issue — assignment compliance skipped` when `closingIssues[]` is empty). The CR wrapper passes the returned block as an embedded block to `@skills/pr-summary/SKILL.md` so the linked-issue audience reads **one consolidated comment** per CR run (per issue #498). **Do not embed** the block into the PR comment — keep the PR comment focused on technical findings and surface the consolidated-comment status in the summary line.
    - @skills/code-review/SKILL.md
    - @skills/security-review/SKILL.md
    - @skills/class-refactoring/SKILL.md — read-only refactoring lens scoped to the PR diff. Surface DRY duplication and tech-debt-reducing changes that apply to lines actually touched by the PR. Do not propose changes outside the diff.

- Run conditionally:
    - **Database operations detected in the diff → `@skills/mysql-problem-solver/SKILL.md` is mandatory.** Trigger pattern list is owned by `@skills/code-review/SKILL.md` Specialized Reviews (raw SQL, Eloquent / query-builder calls, eager loads, model scopes, ModelManager / Repository methods, migrations, seeders, DynamoDB / NoSQL access). Capture its findings and surface them in the published PR comment under the dedicated `## Database Analysis` section (see Output Rules) — never silently fold them into the Critical / Moderate / Minor buckets.
    - Shared state → @skills/race-condition-review/SKILL.md
    - Third-party API or service changes → ensure the **Third-Party API & Service Analysis** step from `@skills/code-review/SKILL.md` is executed for the diff

#### Refactoring & Tech Debt (DRY) Analysis (PR diff only)

1. Restrict the analysis to lines added or modified in the PR — never review untouched code.
2. For each changed block, apply `@skills/class-refactoring/SKILL.md` and look for:
   - duplicated logic that already exists elsewhere (DRY) — verify the change reuses existing logic instead of introducing a parallel implementation, per `@rules/code-review/general.mdc` Reuse Existing Logic section
   - data shaping repeated across Actions/Services/controllers/jobs/listeners/Livewire/commands
   - oversized methods, deep nesting, mixed responsibilities introduced or amplified by the change
3. Each finding must include the file path, the affected line range, and a concrete refactoring that *reduces* tech debt.
4. In-scope refactorings go into the **Refactoring (DRY / Tech Debt Reduction)** section of the PR comment template. Out-of-scope structural problems still belong in **Refactoring Proposals**.

### 4. Post Results

> **Quiet mode (loop iterations from `@skills/process-code-review/SKILL.md`):** when the caller explicitly requests "do not publish; return findings as in-memory markdown for this loop iteration only", **skip the entire Post Results step** — do not post the PR comment, do not post the linked-issue summary. Return the assembled review markdown to the caller and stop. Only the very last (publishing) call from `process-code-review` after convergence runs Post Results in full.

#### Single-comment upsert (per actor)
- Every CR run owns **exactly one PR comment per GitHub actor**. The comment is keyed by the marker `<!-- cr-comment:actor=<gh-login> -->` (auto-appended by the upsert helper) so follow-up runs **edit the existing comment in place** instead of stacking new comments — no quoting, no "Replying to …" threads, no detached follow-up posts.
- Publish via `skills/code-review-github/scripts/upsert-comment.sh <PR-NUMBER|URL> -` (body on stdin). The helper detects the current actor (`gh api user --jq .login`), searches the PR comments for the marker, and either PATCHes the existing comment or POSTs a fresh one. The published URL is emitted on stdout; the action (`created|updated`) on stderr — log it in the PR comment summary line.
- If the upsert helper exits with code 2 (missing tool) or 3 (API failure), fall back to the GitHub MCP server: list comments, locate the marker, then `updateIssueComment` (or `addIssueComment` when absent). Never bypass the marker convention by posting through raw `gh issue comment` / `gh pr comment` — that path stacks duplicates and is forbidden.
- Pre-existing CR comments published **before** this convention was introduced are left untouched. The first marker-scoped run after the change creates a clean comment alongside them; no migration / deletion is performed.

#### Format
- Critical → Moderate → Minor → Refactoring (DRY / Tech Debt Reduction)
- Include file + line in the finding body
- Include actionable fix
- Post all findings inside the single PR comment — never as line-anchored review comments.

- If no findings:
    - post the header block (Status / Counts / Coverage / Issue tracker summary), the `## Coverage` section, and the final `Summary` line only. Omit every other section entirely. Do not append a "No findings identified" line — the Counts line `Critical 0 · Moderate 0 · Minor 0 · Refactoring 0` already signals the clean state and the omitted sections confirm there is nothing to fix.

#### Linked-issue consolidated summary (mandatory — single comment per linked issue)
- After posting the PR comment, delegate the **single consolidated summary on every linked issue** listed in `closingIssues[]` of the JSON loaded in step 1 to `@skills/pr-summary/SKILL.md`. This CR skill must not author its own non-technical template — the goal is a uniform *"Authors / Available behind / Summary of changes / How to test"* output across both trackers that non-technical project managers understand and can act on.
- **Consolidation contract (issue #498):** invoke `pr-summary` exactly once per linked issue and pass it the `## Assignment Compliance` markdown block returned by `@skills/assignment-compliance-check/SKILL.md` as an embedded block. `pr-summary` appends the block verbatim after `How to test` and publishes **one consolidated comment** containing both the change summary and the assignment-compliance verdict. The CR run posts **exactly one comment per linked issue** — never a separate `gh issue comment` for assignment compliance on top of it.
- When invoking `pr-summary`, pass through the PR `author.login` + `commits[].author.login` set and the git `%an <%ae>` log so the published summary credits the **real change author(s)**, never the agent or the identity running this CR. `pr-summary` resolves and prints those identities in its `Authors` line — confirm the line is present in the published comment.
- When invoking `pr-summary`, also pass through any **test-parameter gating** detected in the diff (feature flag, ENV switch, query-string parameter, request header, admin toggle, allow-list) so the published summary carries the `Available behind` line and folds the toggle-enabling step into `How to test` step 1. When the diff contains no such gate, confirm with `pr-summary` that the line is omitted intentionally rather than forgotten.
- Invoke `@skills/pr-summary/SKILL.md` with the **GitHub** tracker target so it renders `@skills/pr-summary/templates/pr-summary-github.md` in GitHub Markdown and **upserts** the comment via `skills/code-review-github/scripts/upsert-comment.sh` on every entry in `closingIssues[]` (one comment per linked issue, per actor — keyed by the marker `<!-- cr-comment:actor=<gh-login> -->`). `pr-summary` mirrors the same format that `@skills/code-review-jira/SKILL.md` posts to JIRA, so reviewers reading either tracker see the same consolidated comment.
- `pr-summary` enforces the no-file-paths / no-line-numbers / no-code-snippets / no-severity-jargon contract by design; technical content stays exclusively on the PR comment. The embedded `Assignment Compliance` block follows the same constraint — it carries plain-language gap descriptions only.
- If `closingIssues[]` is empty, skip this step and note "no linked issue — issue summary skipped" in the PR comment summary line. `assignment-compliance-check` returns the same status in that case so the wrapper does not even build an embedded block.
- If the upsert helper or the GitHub MCP fallback returns a permission error (cross-repo issue, lacking write access), log the failure in the PR comment summary line and continue — do not abort the review.
- For follow-up reviews, the upsert helper **edits the actor's existing linked-issue comment in place** instead of posting a new one. The "one consolidated comment per CR run" rule therefore extends across runs too — each (linked issue, GitHub actor) pair has exactly one comment that gets updated. Old comments authored before this convention was introduced are left in place untouched.

## Output Rules

- Findings only
- No praise
- No “what was checked”
- **Omit empty sections entirely.** Only the header block (Status / Counts / Coverage / Last updated / Issue tracker summary), the `## Coverage` section, and the final `Summary` line are always rendered in the PR comment. Every other section — `Findings` (including each severity sub-heading), `Refactoring (DRY / Tech Debt Reduction)`, `Refactoring Proposals`, and `Database Analysis` — appears **only when it has at least one item**. Never emit `None.` / `Not applicable.` / `n/a` placeholders for empty sections; drop the whole heading and body instead. The Counts line is the single source of "zero" signal so a clean review stays scannable. **History across CR runs** is preserved by GitHub's edit history on the upserted comment — never re-create a `Previous CR Status` section in the body.
- Use exactly three severity levels: Critical, Moderate, Minor
- Add a **Refactoring (DRY / Tech Debt Reduction)** section after the Minor findings whenever the diff contains in-scope tech-debt-reducing changes (DRY duplication, oversized methods, mixed responsibilities). Each item must include `file:line` and a concrete refactoring step.
- Each **Critical** and **Moderate** finding must include:
    - **Faulty Example** — minimal code snippet or input payload reproducing the issue (redact secrets/PII)
    - **Expected Behavior** — single assertable statement (return value, exception, persisted state, emitted event)
    - **Test Hint** — one sentence pointing at the test layer (unit, integration, feature) and entry point
    - **Suggested Fix** — minimal corrected code snippet that resolves the finding. Must comply with `@rules/php/core-standards.mdc` and, for Laravel projects, `@rules/laravel/architecture.mdc`. Use `n/a — <reason>` only when a snippet adds no value over the one-line Fix description (e.g. naming-only changes, dead-code removal, pointers to an existing helper whose name already says enough).
- These four fields exist so `@skills/process-code-review/SKILL.md` can convert each finding into a reproducer test and apply the fix directly from the PR comment.
- Minor findings may omit these fields when no behavior change is implied.
- If reviewed code violates project rules or architecture but is **out of scope** for the current PR, add a **Refactoring Proposals** section with issue drafts (justified by defined rules only)
- When the diff touches database operations (per the trigger list in `@skills/code-review/SKILL.md` Specialized Reviews), the posted PR comment must include a dedicated `## Database Analysis` section **before** `## Coverage`. The section reports only the `mysql-problem-solver` findings (with severity mirroring Critical / Moderate / Minor) and the proposed query rewrite / index reuse / batching fix per `@rules/sql/optimalize.mdc`. Do not include the queries / migrations inspected list or any EXPLAIN / static-analysis summary — those stay inside the internal investigation. When no DB operations are present, omit the section entirely.
- The posted PR comment must always include a `## Coverage` section before the summary line. The section reports the **diff-scoped** script discovered (per the discovery order in `@skills/code-review/SKILL.md` Coverage gate — `vendor/bin/test-coverage-diff` from this package, Phing `test:coverage:diff` / `coverage:diff`, Composer `test:coverage:diff`, or any project-specific `*coverage*diff*` script), the exact command run, and the coverage result for changed lines (or "diff-scoped tooling unavailable" with reason). Never substitute full-suite coverage output (`composer test:coverage`, `pest --coverage` on the whole suite, Phing `coverage`) and never post a CR comment without this section.
- The PR comment summary line must report the issue-tracker summary status — `posted summary to issue #N` (or comma-separated list when multiple), `no linked issue — issue summary skipped`, or `failed to post on issue #N: <reason>` when a permission / network error occurs. Never post a CR comment without it.
- End with summary line
