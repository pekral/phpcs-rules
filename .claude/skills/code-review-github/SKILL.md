# Code Review (GitHub)

## Purpose
Run a full code review for GitHub pull requests and publish findings directly to the PR.

---

## Constraints
- Apply @rules/git/general.mdc
- All output posted to GitHub must be in English
- Never modify code
- Output findings only (no praise)

---

## Execution

### 1. Load Context
- Load PR, linked issue, and comments using CLI or MCP tools
- If multiple PRs exist for one issue, review each independently
- Before reviewing a PR, switch to the PR branch and pull latest changes

#### Issue Context Analysis
Before reviewing code, load and analyze the full linked issue:

1. Fetch the complete GitHub issue — description, all comments, and any referenced attachments or links.
2. Extract from the issue:
   - **Requirements and acceptance criteria** — what the code must do
   - **Expected behavior** — how the feature or fix should work
   - **Edge cases and constraints** — mentioned by the reporter or in comments
   - **Test data** — any sample inputs, payloads, or scenarios provided in the issue
3. Use this context to evaluate whether the implementation fully satisfies the issue — not just whether the code is technically correct.
4. If the issue contains test data or test scenarios, verify they are covered by existing or new tests. Flag missing test coverage as a finding.

### 2. Pre-checks
- If PR has merge conflicts → cancel review

### 3. Run Reviews

- Always run:
    - @skills/code-review/SKILL.md
    - @skills/security-review/SKILL.md
    - @skills/class-refactoring/SKILL.md — read-only refactoring lens scoped to the PR diff. Surface DRY duplication and tech-debt-reducing changes that apply to lines actually touched by the PR. Do not propose changes outside the diff.

- Run conditionally:
    - Database changes → @skills/mysql-problem-solver/SKILL.md
    - Shared state → @skills/race-condition-review/SKILL.md
    - Third-party API or service changes → ensure the **Third-Party API & Service Analysis** step from `@skills/code-review/SKILL.md` is executed for the diff

#### Refactoring & Tech Debt (DRY) Analysis (PR diff only)

1. Restrict the analysis to lines added or modified in the PR — never review untouched code.
2. For each changed block, apply `@skills/class-refactoring/SKILL.md` and look for:
   - duplicated logic that already exists elsewhere (DRY)
   - data shaping repeated across Actions/Services/controllers/jobs/listeners/Livewire/commands
   - oversized methods, deep nesting, mixed responsibilities introduced or amplified by the change
3. Each finding must include the file path, the affected line range, and a concrete refactoring that *reduces* tech debt.
4. In-scope refactorings go into the **Refactoring (DRY / Tech Debt Reduction)** section of the PR comment template. Out-of-scope structural problems still belong in **Refactoring Proposals**.

### 4. Post Results

#### Thread detection
- Before posting, search for an existing code review comment on the PR:
  - Use `gh api` to list PR comments and find one matching the CR format (e.g. contains "Summary:" with severity counts)
  - Store its `comment_id` if found

#### Posting strategy
- **If an existing CR comment is found (follow-up review):**
    - Analyze all previous CR findings and classify each as: **Resolved**, **Deferred**, or **Still open**
    - Include a **Previous CR Status** section at the top of the new review comment (before any new findings)
    - Post **detailed findings** as a new PR comment that references the original CR comment (quote its first line or link to it)
    - GitHub does not support native replies to issue comments — use quoting (e.g. "> Replying to code review from {date}") to create a visual thread

- **If no existing CR comment is found (first review):**
    - Post findings as a single PR comment using CLI tools

#### Format
- Critical → Moderate → Minor → Refactoring (DRY / Tech Debt Reduction)
- Include file + line in the finding body
- Include actionable fix
- Post all findings inside the single PR comment — never as line-anchored review comments.

- If no findings:
    - post: "No findings identified"

---

## Output Rules

- Findings only
- No praise
- No “what was checked”
- Use exactly three severity levels: Critical, Moderate, Minor
- Add a **Refactoring (DRY / Tech Debt Reduction)** section after the Minor findings whenever the diff contains in-scope tech-debt-reducing changes (DRY duplication, oversized methods, mixed responsibilities). Each item must include `file:line` and a concrete refactoring step.
- Each **Critical** and **Moderate** finding must include:
    - **Faulty Example** — minimal code snippet or input payload reproducing the issue (redact secrets/PII)
    - **Expected Behavior** — single assertable statement (return value, exception, persisted state, emitted event)
    - **Test Hint** — one sentence pointing at the test layer (unit, integration, feature) and entry point
- These three fields exist so `@skills/process-code-review/SKILL.md` can convert each finding into a reproducer test directly from the PR comment.
- Minor findings may omit these fields when no behavior change is implied.
- If reviewed code violates project rules or architecture but is **out of scope** for the current PR, add a **Refactoring Proposals** section with issue drafts (justified by defined rules only)
- End with summary line

## Output Format

Use the template defined in `templates/pr-comment-output.md`.

## Output Humanization
- Use [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) for all skill outputs to keep the text natural and human-friendly.
